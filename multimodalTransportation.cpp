// Here's a more complex example of path planning for autonomous cars considering multimodal transportation options, such as integrating public transit and ride-sharing services.

// This example demonstrates how Dijkstra's algorithm can be adapted for path planning in autonomous cars considering multimodal transportation options, 
// such as integrating public transit and ride-sharing services, to optimize travel time and efficiency in urban environments.

// The dijkstra function is modified to perform path planning considering both road-based and transit-based options. 
// It explores road segments and transit edges to find the shortest path from a source intersection to a destination intersection or transit stop.
// The main function initializes both the road and transit networks, performs multimodal path planning using Dijkstra's algorithm, and outputs the shortest path considering both road-based and transit-based options.
