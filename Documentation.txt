An autonomous car needs to travel from its current location in a busy city center to a specific destination on the outskirts of the city.
The city is represented as a graph, where nodes represent intersections and edges represent roads between intersections.
Each road segment has associated weights representing factors such as distance, traffic congestion, speed limits, and the presence of traffic lights or pedestrian crossings.
The autonomous car's onboard system receives real-time data from sensors, cameras, and traffic monitoring systems, providing information about road conditions, traffic flow, accidents, construction zones, and pedestrian activity.

| Graph Representation| The city's road network is represented as a graph, with nodes representing intersections and edges representing road segments between intersections. Each edge has associated weights representing factors such as distance, traffic flow, and other relevant parameters. |
| Dynamic Updates     | The autonomous car's onboard system continuously monitors the environment and receives real-time updates about road conditions, traffic flow, and other relevant factors. This information is used to dynamically update the graph weights to reflect changes in road conditions and traffic patterns. |
| Path Planning       | The autonomous car's path planning module utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal route from the car's current location to the desired destination. The algorithm takes into account the dynamically updated graph weights to determine the shortest or fastest route while considering factors such as traffic congestion, road closures, and other obstacles. |
| Traffic Prediction  | Machine learning models trained on historical traffic data and real-time sensor data can be used to predict future traffic patterns and congestion levels. These predictions can be integrated into the graph weights used by Dijkstra's algorithm to improve route planning and decision-making. |
| Collision Avoidance | In addition to path planning, Dijkstra's algorithm can also be used for collision avoidance. The autonomous car's sensors detect nearby vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and other obstacles. The car's collision avoidance system uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate safe trajectories that avoid potential collisions while still reaching the destination efficiently. |
| Adaptive Planning   | The autonomous car's onboard system continuously evaluates the current route and dynamically adjusts it based on real-time updates and changes in road conditions. If unexpected events occur, such as accidents or road closures, the system reevaluates the route using Dijkstra's algorithm to find alternative paths that minimize travel time and avoid obstacles. |

By utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm in conjunction with real-time data and machine learning techniques, autonomous cars can navigate through complex urban environments safely and efficiently, adapting to changing road conditions and traffic patterns in real time.
