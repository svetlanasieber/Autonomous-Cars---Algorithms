The detectObjects function iterates through a loop to process each frame captured by the car's sensors. The complexity of this loop is O(n), where n is the number of frames to process.
Inside the loop, there's a call to inferObjects function, which simulates running a machine learning model to detect objects in the frame. The computational complexity of this operation can vary depending on the complexity of the model and the size of the input frame. It's often denoted as O(m), where m represents the complexity of the machine learning model.
Similarly, the processDetectedObjects function processes the detected objects, such as performing collision avoidance or path planning. The complexity of this operation can also vary but is typically treated as a constant factor for simplicity.
