# Path Planning:

# Graph Representation:

The city's road network is represented as a weighted graph, where each node represents an intersection and each edge represents a road segment between intersections.
The weights of the edges represent various factors such as distance, speed limit, traffic flow, and other relevant parameters.
Additional information, such as the presence of traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, and one-way streets, is encoded in the graph structure to ensure accurate path planning.
Dynamic Updates:

The autonomous car's onboard system continuously monitors the environment and receives real-time updates about road conditions, traffic flow, weather conditions, and other relevant factors.
This information is used to dynamically update the graph weights to reflect changes in road conditions, traffic congestion, and other factors that may affect route planning.
Path Planning Algorithm:

The autonomous car's path planning module utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal route from the car's current location to the desired destination.
Dijkstra's algorithm considers the dynamically updated graph weights to determine the shortest or fastest route while taking into account factors such as traffic congestion, road closures, speed limits, and other obstacles.
The algorithm explores the graph starting from the current location of the car and iteratively selects the node with the lowest cost until the destination node is reached.
Complex Road Conditions:

The path planning algorithm considers complex road conditions such as one-way streets, intersections with traffic lights, and pedestrian crossings.
Special rules and constraints are applied to ensure that the selected route adheres to traffic regulations and avoids unsafe maneuvers such as illegal turns or driving through red lights.
Multimodal Transportation:

The path planning algorithm may incorporate multimodal transportation options, such as using public transit or ride-sharing services for certain segments of the journey.
Integration with transportation network providers allows the autonomous car to seamlessly transition between different modes of transportation to optimize the overall travel time and efficiency.
